# Prime Skills Check-In

This was a quiz of sorts, early on in the time at Prime.

Fork this repo, then try to complete all of the exercises split into 9 modules.
This is an opportunity to confirm what you know and pinpoint areas you might
need to work on.

Take your time and use any resources you want to explore and
complete each module.

_If you get stuck on one, move on to the next and come back if there's time._
